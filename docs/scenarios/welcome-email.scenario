Welcome Email

When a visitor receives the welcome email, they get a link with a secret code to "Activate my proxy". The link includes a unique identifier that is sufficiently difficult to guess.

Clicking the link in the welcome email means that:

- The [visitor becomes a customer]

- The [proxy setup guide] is displayed in their browser

- The [proxy is activated] immediately
