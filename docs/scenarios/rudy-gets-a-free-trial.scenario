Scenario: Rudy Gets A Free Trial
================================

Rudy maintains a web app and discovers a bug affecting iPad safari. He can't reproduce it in other browsers, so he searches for "ios safari debugger".

Rudy finds us, signs up for a "Free Trial" and follows a link in the welcome email to create his account. He calls his account "rudy87".

Rudy uses his proxy until the free trial usage limit is reached. After the usage limit is exceeded, any web page he visits is redirected to a page prompting upgrade to a paid account, with instructions for removing the proxy configuration from his system should he wish to.
