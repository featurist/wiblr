Free Trial

The free trial lets prospective customers try the service without immediately having to consider whether they can afford it.

To satisfy free trials we need to pay for computation and bandwidth, so it's a loss leader. The aim is to convert visitors into paying customers.

We need to capture the visitor's email address to reduce abuse of free trials. Visitors only get free access via the welcome email.

The "Free Trial" button is very prominent and one of very few interaction options on the home page. Visitors that press the button are prompted to enter their email address and are sent the [welcome email].
