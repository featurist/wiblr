Scenario: Rudy Filters Requests
===============================

Rudy's web application makes lots of network requests but when he's debugging he only cares about a few of them.

Rudy types "GET /poll" into the filter box and the list of requests is filtered to include only requests with the method "GET" and the path "/poll".

Rudy types "404" into the filter box and the list of requests is filtered to include only requests with the response http status code 404.
